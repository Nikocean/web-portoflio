          I am a Frontend Engineer with 2+ years of professional experience
          building and maintaining scalable web applications, primarily using
          Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and Tailwind CSS. I currently work at Kompas.id, where
          I collaborate with cross-functional teams to develop new features,
          optimize performance, and ensure a seamless user experience across
          platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          My core strengths include modern frontend development, API
          integration, code refactoring, and unit testing using tools like Vitest
          and Jest. I’m also experienced in code migration from legacy to modern
          tech stacks, and enjoy working in agile, collaborative environments.
          Beyond my daily role, I’m passionate about continuous learning. I
          regularly explore areas such as mobile development, fullstack
          engineering, AI, and emerging web technologies through online courses
          and hands-on experimentation.
        </p>

          I also have a strong interest in
          multimedia, including photography and videography, which fuels my
          creativity and attention to detail in UI development. Always open to
          exciting challenges and growth opportunities—whether through advancing
          in my current role or exploring new career paths in tech.
